# Mode A — Acoustic Patterning (Bench Protocol)

## Mix (by weight)

- 100 g Ultracal 30
- 15 g black iron oxide (15%)
- 70–75 g water (w/s ≈ 0.70–0.75)
- 0.3 g superplasticizer (0.3% of binder)
- 0.08 g xanthan (0.08%) — tiny

## Steps

1. Dry-run with WATER @ depth 5–8 mm. Sweep **70–200 Hz**; note stable ripples.
2. Mix slurry: pre-disperse oxide in water → add admixtures → sift in Ultracal (30–45 s stir).
3. Pour to 5–8 mm depth; pop bubbles with light IPA mist.
4. Start chosen frequency at low gain; increase until steady ripples appear (no slosh).
5. Hold ~6–10 min until surface loses sheen and motion “freezes”.
6. Stop audio; cure 30–60 min; demold.
7. Log frequency, amplitude setting, depth, time-to-gel. Photograph with raking light.

**Troubleshooting**

- No pattern: reduce depth to 3–5 mm; sweep slower; +superplasticizer.
- Wash-out: reduce amplitude; shorten working time.
- Settling: +xanthan slightly; remobilize with gentle tap before tone.
