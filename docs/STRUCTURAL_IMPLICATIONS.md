# Sonic Ferrocrete Structural Implications

This note tracks early thinking on how sonic- and magnet-shaped cementitious mixes could translate into structural or envelope gains. Treat it as a living document—add back-of-envelope calculations, test results, and literature references as the project evolves.

## 1. Target Applications

- **Lightweight facade panels:** Built-in ribs/grooves for stiffness, drainage, and acoustic diffusion.
- **Shell structures:** Sound-shaped curvature to distribute loads (arches, domes, vaulted roofs).
- **Core-and-skin walls:** Sonic Ferrocrete skin bonded to conventional structural core (reinforced concrete, light-gauge steel).
- **Site-cast slabs:** Rippled slabs or stairs for traction and reduced material usage.

## 2. Pattern → Performance Hypotheses

| Pattern Type | Potential Benefit | Notes / Metrics to Track |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Standing-wave ribs (1D) | Increase bending stiffness with minimal material | Measure section modulus vs. flat panel |
| Hexagonal/“cell” patterns | Distribute loads isotropically; aesthetic texture | Finite-element comparison of stress distribution |
| Magnetite veining | Add localized reinforcement or EM shielding | Analyze shear strength, conductivity, corrosion behavior |
| Gradient relief | Redirect water, enhance acoustic diffusion | Test water shedding (drainage rate), acoustic absorption |

## 3. Structural Considerations

- **Rheology window:** Structural patterns require predictable working time to avoid slump. Log yield stress, plastic viscosity, and gel time for each mix.
- **Pattern depth vs. thickness:** Document ratios (relief depth / panel thickness) that preserve strength. Start with 5–10 mm relief on 20–25 mm panels.
- **Bonding to reinforcement:** Explore how magnetite alignments interact with rebar or mesh; avoid isolating reinforcement from bulk matrix.
- **Thermal movement:** Relief patterns may concentrate shrinkage or expansion stresses—monitor for crack initiation around nodes.
- **Fire performance:** Map how voids or cavities affect heat transfer and spalling risk.

## 4. Test Matrix (Draft)

| Sample | Mix | Pattern | Reinforcement | Tests |
|--------|-----|---------|---------------|-------|
| Panel A | Ultracal baseline | Flat (control) | None | Flexural strength, surface hardness |
| Panel B | Ultracal + magnetite | 120 Hz ripple | None | Flexural, shear, imaging of magnetite bands |
| Panel C | UHPC concept | 90 Hz ripple + magnet veining | GFRP mesh | Flexural, tensile pull-off, freeze–thaw |
| Panel D | Future | Gradient relief | Steel mesh | Thermal cycling, drainage rate |

## 5. Analysis Tools

- Finite-element tools (e.g., Fusion 360, ANSYS, or Grasshopper/Karamba) to simulate patterned plates.
- Digital image correlation for strain mapping (long-term goal).
- Microscope/CT scans to visualize magnetite distribution.

## 6. Open Questions

- What relief amplitudes deliver meaningful stiffness gains without compromising durability?
- How does magnetite concentration affect rebar corrosion or electromagnetic properties?
- Can patterned surfaces reduce cladding weight enough to offset actuation energy costs?
- What building code pathways exist for adopting patterned panels (e.g., ICC-ES reports, ASTM testing)?

## 7. Next Actions

- [ ] Gather literature on ribbed concrete panels and bio-inspired shell structures.
- [ ] Design simple FEA study comparing flat vs. ripple panels.
- [ ] Plan mechanical testing protocol for first patterned slabs (fixtures, load setup).
- [ ] Capture high-resolution surface scans of Mode A/B specimens for analysis.
