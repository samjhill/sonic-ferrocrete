# Mode B — Magnetic Veining

1. Pour same base mix; no tone first.
2. Slide magnet sled under tray in lines/spirals; **pause 10–30 s** where darker ribs desired.
3. Park magnets during gel (~5–10 min), then remove.
4. Optional: low-level tone during painting to keep fines mobile.
5. Cure & demold; photograph.

**Success:** visible dark filaments; sometimes slight raised relief.
