# Transducer Mounting Notes

A repeatable clamp-up between the TT25 (or future BST-1) and the aluminum drive plate keeps energy transfer high and lets you swap plates without tearing epoxy. The workflow below uses reversible components so you can tune the stack quickly.

## Bill of mounting parts

- 3M VHB LSE 110WF tape (25 mm wide) **or** thin layer of Loctite Clover coupling compound
- 1 mm neoprene or sorbothane pad (cut to 60 mm disc) for isolation feet
- Laser-cut/printed collar or four 20 mm corner clamps
- M5 × 35 mm socket cap screws (x4) with wing nuts or thumb nuts
- M5 washers (x8) to protect plate surface
- Optional: 90° toggle clamps (short reach) if you prefer a quick-release mechanism

## Assembly procedure

1. **Prep surfaces:** Clean the aluminum plate and the TT25 puck with isopropyl alcohol. Lightly scuff the puck’s mating face with fine Scotch-Brite for extra grip, then wipe again.
2. **Apply coupling layer:**
   - For VHB tape: cut a 50 mm circle, press onto the puck, then peel the top liner right before mounting.
   - For Clover compound: spread a paper-thin film on the puck using a plastic card. Aim for full coverage without squeeze-out.
3. **Seat the transducer:** Center the TT25 on the underside of the plate. If using VHB, apply firm, even pressure for 30–60 s. For grease, gently twist to break any air pockets.
4. **Clamp:** Place the printed collar or four corner clamps around the puck. Feed M5 screws through the collar into captive nuts/wing nuts above the plate. Tighten gradually in a cross pattern until snug. Do not overtighten; you just need intimate contact.
5. **Add isolation feet:** Adhere rubber isolation pads or sorbothane discs to the bottom of the plate corners. Ensure equal thickness so the tray sits level.
6. **Route wiring:** Zip-tie the transducer leads to one leg of the collar so the cable can’t tug on the puck during sweeps.
7. **Swap plates:** To remove the puck, loosen the clamps, peel the VHB or wipe away coupling compound, and clean surfaces with IPA. Keep spare VHB circles pre-cut for quick changeovers.

## Tips

- Re-check clamp tension after long high-amplitude sweeps—the coupling layer can creep as the plate warms.
- If you upgrade to a BST-1, print a deeper collar: leave 2–3 mm radial clearance and extend screw length to M6 × 45 mm.
- Mark the resonant axes on the plate once identified; aligning the tray with these marks speeds repeatability.
- Keep dedicated “clean” and “messy” plates to avoid cross-contamination of coupling grease and cement slurry.
